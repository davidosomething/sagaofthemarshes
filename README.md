# Saga of the Marshes

I tried to recover this old QBasic game I started making over 12 years ago.

Unfortunately I couldn't recover all of the images from the floppy disk (FAT12).
I'm using a [Sabrent USB floppy drive] and while the disk mounts and some data
is readable (the source code, luckily), the graphics and some map data were not.
It is most certainly there, though -- the disk can sometimes get the filesize.

If anyone has any tips on how to recover the rest, please let me know!
